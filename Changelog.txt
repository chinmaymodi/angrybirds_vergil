TODO:
Create the described heuristic
Improve my heuristic for better scores
Test on a wider range of levels so that I can get better heuristic
Read papers of previous competitions to make a better heuristic
Try to add a learning heuristic that can replay a level multiple times and improve its own score

Version 1.2:

17 November 2014

Added another strategy
This one implements a weight calculation based on type of bird, type and orientation of block, etc.
But seems to show not much improvements.

Version 1.1:

10 November 2014

Modified the original code
Added a simple proximity based heuristic that allows me to find best blocks to hit
So far tested on the first five levels, the bot improved my score on all levels O_O although that might simply be because I am a shitty player :D

THE BEGINNING OF TIME

Simply created the repo and learned commands to modify it in ubuntu
Then realised there was an effortless windows client available as well :| Oh well, atleast I learned something
